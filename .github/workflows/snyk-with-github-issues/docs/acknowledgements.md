# Acknowledgements
This project was developed by Ian Mangan, Elizabeth Mathew, Yashashri Pendse, and Melissa Shohet 
as part of the 2020 summer internship program at [Contrast Security](https://www.contrastsecurity.com).

The project implements several common web application vulnerabilities, in
order for Contrast Security's Go-Agent to successfully demo/showcase 
their products (Assess/Protect).
